# Deploy plugin for Elasticsearch

With this plugin, Elasticsearch plugins can be installed on all nodes, without restarting them.

Examples:

    curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/_deploy' -d '{
        "name" : "test",
        "path" : "/Users/joerg/Projects/github/jprante/elasticsearch-test/target/elasticsearch-plugin-test-1.4.0.0.jar"
    }'

    curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/_deploy' -d '{
        "name" : "demo",
        "path" : "http://example.org/elasticsearch-plugin-demo-1.4.0.0.zip"
    }'

    curl -XPUT '0:9200/_deploy?name=library' -H 'Accept: application/zip' --data-binary @/Users/joerg/Projects/github/xbib/elasticsearch-plugin-library-api/build/distributions/elasticsearch-plugin-library-api-1.4.0.0-plugin.zip

In case of success, the answer of the server looks like this

    {"nodes":[{"name":"Melee","success":true}],"deployed":true}

If a deploy is repeated, the existing plugin with the same name is refreshed: the
services of the old one are stopped and the new plugin replaces the old one.

Deployed plugins are stored under the deploy plugins' directory in the Elasticsearch plugins folder.

If URLs are to be used in `path` for remote access, the URL domain has to be configured beforehand
in Elasticsearch settings by a list of permitted domains.

    plugins.deploy.domains:
        - foo.com
        - bar.org
        - baz

It is possible to get a list of all deployable plugins with

    curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/_deploy'
    {"nodes":[{"name":"Melee","plugins":{"library":"org.xbib.elasticsearch.plugin.library.LibraryPlugin@3564cbc2"}}],"deployed":true}

To remove a deploayble plugin, the files in the deploy plugin folder must be removed and the node must be restarted.

With the ES configuration

    plugins.deploy.enabled: false

the plugin can be deactivated.

# How does it work?

Let's recap the way ES plugins are implemented. Plugin modules are components that extend functionality to exisiting ES services when being
invoked early in the ES initialization phase, before the ES node is ready to start. These features are
baked into ES core services or modules. Also the `onModule()` hook allows this at a very early stage.

Plugin services are also initialized early but started later, after all modules have been initialized.

The deploy plugin is such an ordinary plugin but can manage other plugins, so called `deployable plugins`.
For this it is required that a plugin follows these rules:

- it must prepare at least one service where the start and stop is implemented by `doStart()` and `doStop()` of `org.elasticsearch.common.component.AbstractLifecycleComponent`
- it should not register modules that are "baked" into the ES node

But, most of existing plugins do the latter, so it can not be expected they work without modifications.

How can plugins be redeployed when most features are baked into ES?

The deploy plugin solves the redeploy problem by doing the following

- at deploy time, it looks for the service(s) of a deployable plugin, and invokes the start method
- and at redeploy time, the stop method of the service of a deployed plugin is executed before the start method is executed again

So, the deploy plugin realizes a resource life cycle, controlled by RESTful actions.

A special interface `org.xbib.elasticsearch.module.deploy.DeployableComponent`
adds another interesting feature that a deployable plugin can be initialized by seeing the classpath it is running under
and the jar of the plugin where the file `es-plugin.properties` was stored. This allows for example
to create a zipfs file system on the plugin jar for resource retrieval.

It is up to each deployable plugin to release any resources that would hinder reusage, e.g.
closing open ports.

The deploy plugin does not care about or tweak the core ES services, they are not manipulated.

# WARNING

The plugin should only be used by Elasticsearch administrators. Unauthorized plugin installs can fetch unknown
code from URLs, execute arbitrary code, open ports and may expose systems to unknown risks.

Use at your own risk!
