# Deploy plugin for Elasticsearch

With this plugin, Elasticsearch plugins can be installed on all nodes, without restarting them.

Examples:

    curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/_deploy' -d '{
        "name" : "test",
        "path" : "/Users/joerg/Projects/github/jprante/elasticsearch-test/target/elasticsearch-plugin-test-1.4.0.0.jar"
    }'

    curl -XPOST 'localhost:9200/_deploy' -d '{
        "name" : "demo",
        "path" : "http://example.org/elasticsearch-plugin-demo-1.4.0.0.zip"
    }'

    curl -XPUT '0:9200/_deploy?name=library' -H 'Accept: application/zip' --data-binary @/Users/joerg/Projects/github/xbib/elasticsearch-plugin-library-api/build/distributions/elasticsearch-plugin-library-api-1.4.0.0-plugin.zip

In case of success, the answer of the server looks like this

    {"nodes":[{"name":"Melee","success":true}],"deployed":true}

If a deploy is repeated, the existing plugin with the same name is refreshed: the
services of the old one are stopped and the new plugin replaces the old one.

Deployed plugins are stored under the deploy plugins' directory in the Elasticsearch plugins folder.

If URLs are to be used in `path` for remote access, the URL domain has to be configured beforehand
in Elasticsearch settings by a list of permitted domains.

    plugins.deploy.domains:
        - foo.com
        - bar.org
        - baz

It is possible to get a list of all deployable plugins with

    curl -XGET 'localhost:9200/_deploy'
    {"nodes":[{"name":"Melee","plugins":{"library":"org.xbib.elasticsearch.plugin.library.LibraryPlugin@3564cbc2"}}],"deployed":true}

To remove a deploayble plugin, the files in the deploy plugin folder must be removed and the node must be restarted.

# WARNING

The plugin should only be used by Elasticsearch administrators. Unauthorized plugin installs can fetch unknown
code from URLs, execute arbitrary code, open ports and may expose systems to unknown risks.

Use at your own risk!
